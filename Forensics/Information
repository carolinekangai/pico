Downloaded a jpg image 

In it was a cat and the background a laptop screen with a terminal open showing scala programming language

The language got no hits so i looked at the hints again:Look at the details of the file

This must be about meta data so i used exiftool to extract

International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) focuses on content of images together with their status in regard to ownership and licenses and rights

Exif data or meta data is concerned with the technical side of the picture eg camera used setting etc

Exif data is automatically added (and can be removed) but IPTC data is manually added

The IPTC data and license data are checksums 

The license data was passes through cyberchef from base64 and brought : picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}

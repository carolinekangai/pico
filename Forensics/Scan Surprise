SSH into the network hit ls and a qr image

Hint:If you don't have access to a phone, you can also use zbar-tools to convert an image to text

I tried to use: scp  ctf-player@atlas.picoctf.net:/home/ctf-player/drop-in/flag.png /home/caroline/Downloads
 Which would download the image to my local file but scp is blocked

I also tried sftp then get filename but sftp is blocked as well

I used zbarimg and got picoCTF{p33k_@_b00_3f7cf1ae}

Logged in to burp on my kali and inputed the http link given by pico into the target in chrominium

The web loaded and it just showed a site with to buttons for red and blue. You click red the site is red, you click blue the site is blue.

I look at the title of the game, its weird but it says sth.....get and head. Those are terms in html

And the hint:Maybe you have more than 2 choices

So maybe i need to get sth in head. also the head in burp is pink in pretty so maybe te third option is pink?

When i inspect the site i see white is a background color

I change GET to HEAD in target and see picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_8f878508}

HINT:Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?

I inspect the page and i add /script.js[cause i kept seeing it] and it says  

   function greetings()
{
  alert("This code is in a separate file!");
}

//  f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}


Then i also run style.css and it showed
  body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/*  picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_  */


my flag: picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}

I learn to check references links to see if they harbor sensitive data

Hint: How is the password checked on this website?
It is alogin page where you enter user and password

I inspect and find 2 links that i can check out- admin.php and secure.js

I try admin.php but i am not authorised

I then try secure.js and it returns
  
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}

I then go back to log in page and input user as admin and password as strongpassword098765 

My flag  picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_a8788e61}
